## 10. Troubleshooting

### Problem: URL Preview Shows "No settings found"
**Cause:** The pasted URL doesn't contain NetflixCare filter parameters.
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you copied the complete ShareView URL from NetflixCare
- Ensure the URL starts with "https://netflixcare.sprinklr.com"
- Try creating a new search with filters in NetflixCare and get a fresh ShareView URL

### Problem: Settings Don't Save
**Cause:** Browser permission or storage issues.
**Solution:**
- Refresh the settings page and try again
- Check that Chrome storage permissions are enabled for the extension
- Try resetting to defaults and reconfiguring

### Problem: Dark Mode Not Working
**Cause:** Theme setting conflicts or caching.
**Solution:**
- Try switching to Light mode, save, then back to Dark mode
- Refresh the page after changing themes
- Clear your browser cache if the problem persists

### Problem: Filters Not Applied in Searches
**Cause:** "Keep filters" setting or URL configuration issues.
**Solution:**
- Verify "Keep filters from ShareView URL" is checked
- Confirm your ShareView URL contains the desired filters in the preview
- Check that the URL preview shows your expected filters

---

### Problem: Search Mode Not Remembered
**Cause:** "Remember Toggle State" setting is disabled.

### Problem: First-Time Popup Keeps Appearing

**Solution:**
- Clear browser extension data and reconfigure
- Check Chrome storage permissions for the extension
- Manually dismiss with "Got it!" button rather than closing browser

### Problem: Toggles Not Working Correctly
**Cause:** Conflicting settings or corrupted preferences.
